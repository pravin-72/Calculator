## How I approached this Project :

In approaching the Calculator project for GitHub, I followed a systematic and iterative development process to create a user-friendly and functional application. Here's a brief overview of my approach:

**1. Project Planning:** I started by defining the project's scope and objectives. I outlined the features I wanted to include, such as basic arithmetic operations, memory functions, and keyboard support.

**2. HTML Structure:** I designed the calculator's user interface using HTML, creating the necessary buttons, display area, and layout. I made sure the structure was simple and intuitive for users.

**3. CSS Styling:** Next, I applied CSS styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive. I focused on creating a clean and modern design while ensuring it worked well on different devices.

**4. JavaScript Logic:** I implemented the calculator's functionality using JavaScript. This involved handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying results dynamically on the screen. I also added error handling for invalid inputs.

**5. Testing and Debugging:** Throughout the development process, I conducted thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues. I used the browser's developer tools to inspect elements and debug the JavaScript code.

**6. Refinement and Iteration:** After completing the core functionality, I refined the user interface, improved code readability, and optimized performance. I iterated on the design and functionality to enhance the user experience.

**7. Documentation:** To ensure clarity and ease of understanding for other developers, I documented the code and added comments where necessary. This documentation helps anyone who wishes to contribute or modify the project in the future.
